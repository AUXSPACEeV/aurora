# `AURORA`

> **AU**xspace **RO**cket ope**RA**tingÂ System

## Introduction

**AURORA** is an open-source software project developed by Auxspace e.V.,
a student-driven initiative dedicated to building rockets and providing
hands-on aerospace engineering experience.
This project is specifically designed for the **METER-2** rocket,
incorporating a modular electronics stack for optimal performance and
flexibility.

The **AURORA** system leverages a series of interconnected PCBs
communicating over **CAN**, with each PCB housing a microchip running
the **AURORA** software.
The primary purpose of **AURORA** is to serve as avionics software,
managing essential data such as air pressure, acceleration, gyro, and
magnetometer readings.
Using the **FreeRTOS** kernel, **AURORA** handles task
scheduling and real-time operations, enabling reliable and efficient
communication between multiple **AURORA** instances through
**CAN**.

Join us as we continue to develop and refine **AURORA**,
contributing to the advancement of rocket technology and student
expertise in aerospace engineering!

## Building AURORA

<details> <summary> <b>Build Dependencies</b> (<i>click</i> to open) </summary>
The only dependency that is needed for <b>AURORA</b> to be built is
<b>Docker</b>.
</details>

Building AURORA works with the `run.sh` script in this git repositories
root directory:

```bash
./run.sh build
```

<details> <summary> <b>Build AURORA without the wrapper</b> (<i>click</i> to open) </summary>
The project can also be built by using <b>CMake</b> and <b>Make</b> in
the traditional way.
However, to do this, <b>pico-sdk</b> and <b>picotool</b> need to be
installed.

Once the environment is set up, you will need to add the following
environment variables and make sure they are visible to <b>CMake</b>:

```bash
# env
export PICO_SDK_PATH="${PATH_TO_PICO_SDK}"
export FREERTOS_KERNEL_PATH="$PATH_TO_SRC_KERNEL"  # optional

# prepare build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../src

# build
make
```

</details>

## Installing AURORA

After building the firmware, the build output is generated under `build/`.
There should be a file `aurora.uf2` which can be transferred onto the
board, either via USB or the RPI Debug Probe.

## Acknowledgements

This project relies on several tools and libraries that have greatly
contributed to its development:

* **picotool**: A tool for managing and interacting with Raspberry Pi Pico
devices.
* **FreeRTOS**: An open-source real-time operating system kernel used for
task scheduling.
* **pico-sdk**: The official SDK for programming Raspberry Pi Pico boards,
providing essential APIs and hardware support.
* **pico-project-generator**: A project generator for setting up new
Raspberry Pi Pico projects with ease.

AURORA is designed not to be the most abstract or highly efficient
software, but rather to be easily understandable and enjoyable to
develop.
The <b>Auxspace</b> team has experimented with several different
approaches to <b>AURORA</b>, including using the <b>Zephyr</b> or
<b>Embassy</b> operating systems and bare-metal programming.
Ultimately, the team decided on <b>FreeRTOS</b> as the operating system
kernel and the <b>pico-sdk</b> for its ease of use and well-documented
hardware support.

The primary purpose of this project is for the team to gain a deeper
understanding of low-level programming, real-time operating systems,
and general software development.

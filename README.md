### Introduction

**AURORA** is an open-source software project developed by Auxspace e.V.,
a student-driven initiative dedicated to building rockets and providing
hands-on aerospace engineering experience.
This project is specifically designed for the **METER-2** rocket,
incorporating a modular electronics stack for optimal performance and
flexibility.

The **AURORA** system leverages a series of interconnected PCBs
communicating over **CAN**, with each PCB housing a microchip running
the **AURORA** software.
The primary purpose of **AURORA** is to serve as avionics software,
managing essential data such as air pressure, acceleration, gyro, and
magnetometer readings.
Using the **Zephyr** kernel, **AURORA** handles task
scheduling and real-time operations, enabling reliable and efficient
communication between multiple **AURORA** instances through
**CAN**.

Join us as we continue to develop and refine **AURORA**,
contributing to the advancement of rocket technology and student
expertise in aerospace engineering!

## Setup

Setup Zephyr using either the docker container in this directory or follow the
[Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)
from the Zephyr project.

### Docker

If you don't want to install all Zephyr dependencies by yourself and system-wide,
this repository also comes with a configured docker container.

To install docker, head to the
[docker install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/),
select your distro and follow the instructions.

[podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
also works for this project and can be selected using the `--engine`
option in the `run.sh` wrapper.

### Container and Zephyr Workspace

After installing docker, all requirements are met to run the wrapper script:

```bash
# Open a shell in the development container for the rpi_pico board
./run.sh -b rpi_pico shell
```

The Zephyr workspace is configured to be at *$(pwd)/..*.
Zephyr itself is then found at *<zephyr-workspace>/zephyr* and this
application at *<zephyr-workspace>/<aurora>*.

*<zephyr-workspace>/<aurora>* is mounted into the container,
so changes that you perform inside the container will take effect in this
repository and vice-versa.

Run `west update` in *<zephyr-workspace>* to update modules.

**example**:

```bash
# Set up workspace directories
mkdir zephyr-workspace && cd zephyr-workspace

# Clone the project into the workspace
git clone https://github.com/AUXSPACEeV/aurora.git aurora
cd aurora

# Run the container
./run.sh -b rpi_pico shell
```

## Build

The following command is an example of how to use west when building an
application:

```bash
# Build the sensor_board project for the rpi pico
west build -b rpi_pico sensor_board
```

The output from the build will be at
*<zephyr-workspace>/<aurora>/build/zephyr*
called `zephyr.uf2` and `zephyr.elf`.

## Deployment

### West

Deploy the binary to your board by either using `west flash` or in case of the
Raspberry Pi Pico series, copy it onto the Pi's storage.

Currently, flashing from inside the docker container is untested and
unimplemented.

### Openocd

Natively, you can use openocd and gdb to flash and debug an application:

```bash
# Flash the PI
sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program build/zephyr/zephyr.elf verify reset exit"

# Attach to debug probe
sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000"

# Connect gdb to openocd
gdb build/zephyr/zephyr.elf
>target remote localhost:3333
>monitor reset init

# Start debugging!
```

### Standard USB Interface

The RP2040 comes with a backup bootloader, in case the QSPI Flash is not
reachable by the ROM bootloader.
The `BOOTSEL` switch deasserts the QSPI CS pin and opens up the fallback
loader, which is a simple USB interface.
When connecting the PI to your PC in this state, the PI is registered as
an external drive called `RPI-RP2`, which can load `.uf2` files.

Copy the files from your drive to the volume like so:

```bash
# Linux example
cp build/zephyr/zephyr.uf2 /mount/${USER}/RPI-RP2
```

The PI should reboot and immediately start running your uploaded
application.
